        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics and economics that studies strategic decision-making in situations where the outcome of one participant's choices depends on the choices made by others. It provides a framework for analyzing and predicting the behaviour of rational individuals or groups in competitive or cooperative settings. In this club, you will learn a bunch of game theory concepts that can be applied to the real world such as the Nash Equilibrium, mixed strategy, dominant strategy, etc.

            <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to empower individuals within our club with the analytical tools of game theory, enabling strategic acumen and insightful decision-making in competitive and cooperative settings. We envision a community where the transformative principles of game theory are embraced, guiding us towards a future where rationality and cooperation intertwine harmoniously to drive collective success and understanding in the intricacies of interactive decision-making.
